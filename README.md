# MoodyWebsite
A website for Moody to start tying together core web tech together. (html, css, js)
This is just for fundamentals and exploring web dev before diving into the weeds.

1. Gitting started with Git ;)
  a. You should be able to download a zip from a green button on the main /MoodyWebsite page here in GitHub.
  b. Extract that into a folder you'll remember. 
  c. You'll open that folder in Brackets or whatever editor you decide to use.
  d. Along with setting up a github account on the browser (or mobile), you're going to want to download the Git Client and get that setup. This link should help.

2. You'll have to kinda of "understand" what Git is really all about and how its the standard for coders all over the world.
  Give this article a quick read. I skimmed it and that's how I would basically summarize it.

  Essentially what we should get into the ryhthm of doing is doing little test projects, you uploading code, me checking that code (making adjustments if needed), etc.  This way two things are happening, you're learning Git, and it's easier to colloborate without having to be in a call.
  
3. Hopefully by the end of a few months we'll have not only front end websites, but we could also create some interesting applications as well, (some of which may be embedabble into our websites!!!)
